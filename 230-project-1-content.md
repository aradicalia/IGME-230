## I. High Concept
You play as a knight traveling across a monochrome world, solving puzzles to collect light sources. 

## II. Genre
"the dark is coming" is an platformer-puzzle game. 

## III. Platform
It will be browser only - sorry, mobile users!

## IV. Story
The dark is coming. To combat the rising shadows, your kingdom has sent you to find the light... however possible.
### Themes and Mood
Warmth and the fight of light versus dark will be major themes. The mood is urgent and tense - the dark is coming, after all.
### Narrative, Premise, and Player Motivation
You play as a knight who's been sent on a quest to collect light, which will be your goal throughout the game. You start from the 
kingdom's main castle and head right from there, where all the puzzles await you. (There's no value in going left after you finish
the puzzles you pass.) There will be an inventory in which you can see which light sources you currently have and which ones you're 
missing still. 

## V. Aesthetics
### Graphics Style
Super simple. I'm imagining everything to be pretty much monochrome, with the lights that you collect being warm-colored
(red, orange, yellow). It'll likely be pixel art, with a hand-drawn feeling. 
### Sound
I'll have a "main" track (during the platformer parts), a track that plays during puzzles, and a title track (before actual gameplay).
These will be taken from a free-license site I know of (Maou Damashii). 
### SFX
I'll also be using Maou Damashii for my sound effects, and if I can't find them there, I'll look elsewhere for free-to-use assets. 
As of now, I'll need SFX for the following: a timer for any puzzle that needs it, button clicks, and things like striking a match.

## VI. Gameplay
### Mechanics
The mechanics in the game include achievement (of the light sources), countdown (during puzzles), pride (over the light you collect), progression dynamic (seen through the inventory), and virtual items (also the light sources).
### Control
You'll need a keyboard and mouse - the keyboard's WASD/arrow keys and space to move and jump, respectively, as well as opening various
menus, and the mouse to solve puzzles. 
### "Onboarding"
There will be a tutorial menu/pop-up after the main menu and before actual gameplay that details the controls. Otherwise, it should
be immediately obvious that the player needs to move around the platforms in order to play.
### Player Learning
There's not much of it - hopefully I can design the later puzzles to be challenging enough without figuring things out immediately,
but for the most part, the platformer aspect will be fairly simple. If possible, I may try to do "jump quest" type of platforms in
some areas of the map, where the jumps are hard and the stakes are high, and very very pointy. (I personally suck at jump quests.)

## VIII. Other
The name comes from both the "The Dark is Rising" book series by Susan Cooper and "the light is coming" by Ariana Grande. 

## IX. About the developer
My name is Calise Jin. I'm a second year Game Design & Development major, hoping to minor in Japanese and take a few NMID classes 
if possible. I have fine arts experience (but I suck at painting), which is fine because I prefer pencils and digital art. I'm experienced in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Adobe Effects, and am capable of graphic design. I'd love to learn more about composing music.
